Week 3 Homework - Password Generator

This project was created to demonstrate a basic understanding of Javascript and how it interacts and enhances HTML and CSS. The intent is to create a random password generator that includes any of the following; uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Additionally the user is given the choice to include at least one of the above and will be prompted if they don't. The use can also choose a specific length with the given parameters and again prompted if they don't. It was a great project!
